# OpenGeoMetadata Viewer

A web-based viewer for previewing [OpenGeoMetadata](https://opengeometadata.org/) records. Try the [online demo](http://opengeometadata.org/ogm-viewer/)!

## Installation

You can add the viewer to your project by including the following script tag in your HTML:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/ogm-viewer"></script>
```

If using a bundler, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install ogm-viewer
```

Then add it to your entrypoint file:

```javascript
import 'ogm-viewer';
```

That one import is all of it, whichever way you installed it: the theme and the icons the viewer's own chrome is drawn with are part of the bundle, so there is no stylesheet to import beside it, nothing to copy into your app's assets, and no bundler configuration to add.

## Usage

Once installed, the viewer can be used in your HTML as a web component:

```html
<ogm-viewer record-url="https://example.com/record.json"></ogm-viewer>
```

The `record-url` attribute should point to a valid [OpenGeoMetadata Aardvark](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/) record in JSON format.

You can also programmatically set the record URL using JavaScript:

```javascript
const viewer = document.querySelector('ogm-viewer');
viewer.recordUrl = 'https://example.com/record.json';
```

When the record URL changes, the viewer will automatically fetch and display the record data.

### Search within a scanned map

The viewer automatically adds a search tab when the record's `dct_references_s`
advertises a [IIIF Content Search 2](https://iiif.io/api/search/2.0/)
endpoint under the reference URI `http://iiif.io/api/search`:

```json
{
  "dct_references_s": "{\"http://iiif.io/api/presentation#manifest\":\"https://example.com/map/manifest.json\",\"http://iiif.io/api/search\":\"https://example.com/v1/resources/map-1/iiif/search\"}"
}
```

That makes the Aardvark record URL the only per-record configuration the
embedding page needs:

```html
<ogm-viewer record-url="https://example.com/records/map-1.json"></ogm-viewer>
```

Results containing a `FragmentSelector` (`xywh`) or polygon `SvgSelector` can
be selected to open the image preview, zoom to the matching text, and highlight
it. The panel presents each Gazetteer entity once with its strongest available
OCR crop, rather than exposing multiple extraction candidates to the reader.

`http://iiif.io/api/search` is an OGM reference-key proposal used by this fork;
it is not currently listed in the official OpenGeoMetadata Reference URIs
registry. It follows the registry's existing convention of using a stable API
URI as the key and the record-specific service endpoint as the value.

`search-url` remains available as an explicit override, including for records
that do not advertise the service themselves:

```html
<ogm-viewer record-url="https://example.com/records/map-1.json" search-url="https://example.com/v1/resources/map-1/iiif/search"></ogm-viewer>
```

The core contract is standard IIIF. A service can optionally attach richer evidence to an annotation under `myrdal:evidence`; when present, the search panel treats the Gazetteer entity as the primary result, keeps OCR as supporting evidence, and shows the best available image crop for that entity. Other IIIF Content Search services work without that extension.

`searchUrl` is also a DOM property. Search requests use the viewer's `requestTransform`, so the same URL-scoped cookie or authorization policy used for restricted records can cover the search API. Do not place a private bearer token in HTML or in the URL; prefer a same-origin proxy, cookies, or a browser-safe read credential.

### Dark mode support

The viewer supports dark mode. If your system preference is set to prefer dark mode, the viewer will automatically apply dark styles.

To programmatically control dark mode, you can use the `theme` attribute with a value of `dark` or `light`:

```html
<ogm-viewer record-url="https://example.com/record.json" theme="dark"></ogm-viewer>
```

### Basemaps

By default, the viewer draws on one of [CARTO](https://carto.com/basemaps)'s basemaps: Dark Matter in dark mode, Positron in light mode. To use a different one for either mode, set `dark-basemap` and/or `light-basemap` to a URL for a [MapLibre style document](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/), from CARTO or anywhere else:

```html
<ogm-viewer record-url="https://example.com/record.json" light-basemap="https://api.maptiler.com/maps/basic-v2/style.json?key=your-key"></ogm-viewer>
```

CARTO watermarks a basemap requested without an API key. If you have [your own CARTO API key](https://carto.com/basemaps/apikey/), build the full style URL yourself and pass that:

```html
<ogm-viewer
  record-url="https://example.com/record.json"
  dark-basemap="https://basemaps.cartocdn.com/gl/dark-matter-gl-style/style.json?key=your-key"
  light-basemap="https://basemaps.cartocdn.com/gl/positron-gl-style/style.json?key=your-key"
></ogm-viewer>
```

You can find basemaps that don't require an API key to use offered by [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/quick_start/).

Both attributes are also DOM properties, so they can be set from JavaScript the same way `theme` can. They're supported everywhere `theme` is - `<ogm-viewer>`, `<ogm-preview>`, `<ogm-previews>`, `<ogm-map>`, `<ogm-locator>`, and `<ogm-overview>` - and GeoBlacklight uses them to let a site configure its own basemaps.

### Colors

You can style the viewer's colors by setting CSS custom properties on its element.

```css
ogm-viewer {
  --ogm-data-color: #8f1414;
}
```

Here are the supported properties and what they apply to:

| Property                       | Applies to                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `--ogm-data-color`             | Polygon fill, line geometry, and circle fill         |
| `--ogm-highlight-color`        | The same, for a hovered feature                      |
| `--ogm-selected-color`         | The same, for the feature whose attributes are shown |
| `--ogm-invalid-color`          | The same, for a feature marked unavailable           |
| `--ogm-marker-color`           | Disc a numbered result's marker is drawn on          |
| `--ogm-marker-highlight-color` | The same, for the highlighted result                 |
| `--ogm-stroke-color`           | Polygon outlines and circle borders                  |
| `--ogm-stroke-highlight-color` | Outline of a hovered feature                         |
| `--ogm-stroke-selected-color`  | Outline of the selected feature                      |
| `--ogm-stroke-invalid-color`   | Outline of a feature marked unavailable              |
| `--ogm-text-color`             | Feature label text color                             |
| `--ogm-text-halo-color`        | Feature label text outline color                     |
| `--ogm-text-size`              | Feature label font size, in pixels                   |
| `--ogm-font-family`            | Feature label font name (e.g. `"Noto Sans Regular"`) |
| `--ogm-marker-font`            | CSS font stack for a numbered marker's numeral       |
| `--ogm-data-opacity`           | Initial opacity of drawn data                        |
| `--ogm-highlight-opacity`      | Opacity of a highlighted feature                     |
| `--ogm-bounds-opacity`         | Initial opacity of a bounding box or index map       |
| `--ogm-padding`                | Gap kept between the data and the view edge (pixels) |
| `--ogm-overview-padding`       | Gap for locator and overview maps (pixels)           |

By default, the viewer uses styles from [Web Awesome](https://webawesome.com/) that match the current mode (dark or light).

You usually only need the four `--ogm-*-color` properties, plus `--ogm-text-color`. The rest are derived:

- Each outline comes from the color it outlines, moved away from the basemap: darker in light mode, lighter in dark mode. A color you name is used in both modes, but its outline follows the mode, so one declaration reads on either basemap.
- The label halo comes from `--ogm-text-color`, as black or white — whichever contrasts more, the same choice CSS `contrast-color()` makes. It doesn't consult the mode, because the text color already did.
- The disc a numbered result sits on comes from the same color, sunk to a fixed depth rather than moved by a step, so the numeral on it is legible on either basemap. The numeral's own color follows from the disc, the same way a halo follows from its text.

A numbered marker is drawn as one image — a disc with its numeral on it — rather than as a circle with text over it. That's what keeps every marker the same size at every zoom, keeps a numeral from ever landing on the marker next to it, and lets the numerals be bold: `--ogm-font-family` names a glyph set the basemap has to serve, while `--ogm-marker-font` is an ordinary CSS stack this library draws with itself.

`--ogm-marker-*`, `--ogm-stroke-*` and `--ogm-text-halo-color` are there if you want particular ones instead. Like the other colors, one you name is used in both modes.

### Restricted content

For previews of data that need authentication to access, you can set a custom `requestTransform` function to add headers or cookies to the request. It's a DOM property on `<ogm-viewer>` that you can set in JavaScript, like the `recordUrl` property:

```javascript
viewer.requestTransform = (url, resourceType) => {
  // If we aren't requesting something from the restricted area, don't do anything
  if (!url.startsWith('https://geo.my-domain.edu/restricted/')) return undefined;

  // Otherwise, add an Authorization header with a bearer token
  return { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } };
};
```

If you're building a `Resource` by hand instead, pass the same kind of function as its last constructor argument (or to `resourcesFor`, if you're building several from a record):

```javascript
import { GeoJsonResource } from 'ogm-viewer/lib';

const resource = new GeoJsonResource('my-layer', 'https://example.com/restricted/data.json', undefined, requestTransform);
```

The `requestTransform` will be applied to all requests made by the viewer for that resource, including metadata and tiles, as well as the requests for the MapLibre basemap. The one exception to this is Georeferenced maps using the Allmaps plugin – there's currently no way to fetch these using authentication (see below for more).

### Georeferenced maps

A scanned map with a [IIIF Georeference Annotation](https://iiif.io/api/extension/georef/) is previewable two ways: as an image to page through, and as a layer warped onto the map. Both come from one `IIIFManifestResource`, so `<ogm-viewer>` shows them as two tabs, image first.

The viewer finds the annotation itself, looking in this order:

1. Inside the manifest, following the annotation pages a canvas links until it finds one.
2. Failing that, a `dct_references_s` key of `https://iiif.io/api/extension/georef/1/context.json` pointing at a standalone annotation.

When a record has both, the copy in the manifest wins. Only the first canvas is inspected, so a paged object with an annotation per page is left alone for now.

The map tab is drawn flat, has no globe button, and can't be tilted. These are constraints based on Allmaps' rendering engine, which is used to warp the image. There's also no way to hook into Allmaps' tile requests, so if the annotation points at a restricted image, it won't be able to fetch it. The viewer will still show the image tab, but the map tab will be blank.

To build a preview by hand, the manifest resource takes the standalone annotation URL as its last argument, and works out the rest:

```javascript
import { GeoreferencePreviewer, IIIFManifestResource } from 'ogm-viewer/lib';

const resource = new IIIFManifestResource('my-map', manifestUrl, undefined, undefined, annotationUrl);
if (await resource.isGeoreferenced()) {
  document.querySelector('ogm-preview').previewer = new GeoreferencePreviewer(resource);
}
```

### Components

If you're building your own viewer, you can adopt `<ogm-viewer>`'s components individually.

The easiest way to render a single preview without the full viewer is to use the `<ogm-preview>` component with a `Previewer` and corresponding `Resource`. For example, to preview a GeoJSON resource:

```javascript
import 'ogm-viewer';
import { GeoJsonPreviewer, GeoJsonResource } from 'ogm-viewer/lib';

await customElements.whenDefined('ogm-preview');

const resource = new GeoJsonResource('my-layer', 'https://example.com/data.json');
document.querySelector('ogm-preview').previewer = new GeoJsonPreviewer(resource);
```

Note that `previewer` is a DOM property, not an attribute — await for the element to be defined and then set it in JavaScript.

For more than one preview, `<ogm-previews>` renders the same tab strip `<ogm-viewer>` uses. Hand it a `record` and it works out what that record offers; hand it `previewers` and it uses those instead:

```javascript
document.querySelector('ogm-previews').previewers = [new GeoJsonPreviewer(geoJsonResource), new OpenIndexMapPreviewer(indexMapResource)];
```

`record` and `previewers` are DOM properties too. Neither component has an intrinsic size, so the embedding page should set it via CSS.

#### Cooperative gestures

`<ogm-preview>`, `<ogm-locator>`, and `<ogm-overview>` all require a reader to hold Ctrl (⌘ on a Mac) to zoom the map with the scroll wheel, and a second finger to pan it on a touchscreen, so that a map sitting inside a page doesn't steal the scroll a reader meant for the page around it. Set `cooperative-gestures` to `false` on any of them to turn this off and answer to the wheel and a single touch right away:

```html
<ogm-locator record-url="https://example.com/record.json" cooperative-gestures="false"></ogm-locator>
```

#### Locator maps

To show where a single record is on earth, you can use the `<ogm-locator>` component. Give it a `record-url` and it fetches and draws that record's full geometry (`locn_geometry`) or its bounding box (`dcat_bbox`) if there's no geometry available - the same URL and format `<ogm-viewer>` takes:

```html
<ogm-locator record-url="https://example.com/record.json"></ogm-locator>
```

If you already have an `OgmRecord`, hand it over directly instead:

```js
await customElements.whenDefined('ogm-locator');

document.querySelector('ogm-locator').record = record;
```

`record` is a DOM property, not an attribute; `recordUrl` is both, so either can be set from HTML or JavaScript. If you've built a `LocationPreviewer` yourself, set `previewer` instead to override them.

Like the other components, `<ogm-locator>` has no intrinsic size, so the embedding page should give it one:

```css
ogm-locator {
  height: 250px;
}
```

#### Overviews and geosearch

For showing where several records are and searching/filtering them, you can use the `<ogm-overview>` component. Hand it a list of `OgmRecord`s as `records` and it draws a numbered marker for each one, in the order you gave them.

```js
await customElements.whenDefined('ogm-overview');

document.querySelector('ogm-overview').records = [record1, record2];
```

Nothing of a record is drawn but its number, at the middle of its extent. A record with no geometry still takes up its number, so the numbers keep matching the rows in the list beside the map. Hand it a list of `LocationPreviewer`s you built and those are numbered instead of the records (GeoBlacklight does this).

A user's pointer over a number highlights that record and draws its geometry or bounding box temporarily. The `highlightChange` event says which record it is, so you can use this information to update other parts of the page.

```js
overview.addEventListener('highlightChange', event => markRow(event.detail?.place));
```

The event detail carries the result's place in the list (counted from one) and the id of the record it came from and is `null` once the pointer has left every number.

To highlight a record explicitly, set `highlighted` to either its number in the list (counted from one), or the id of the record it came from. Anything else will clear the current highlight. Setting `highlighted` to explicitly highlight a record doesn't fire `highlightChange`, so you won't get an infinite loop.

```js
overview.highlighted = record.id; // or 3, or undefined to clear it
```

Enable `geosearch` and a reader can search the map by holding shift and dragging a box over it. The area they drew is reported through the `boundsChange` event. The help text in the viewer about how to search can be controlled with `searchHelpText`.

```html
<ogm-overview geosearch></ogm-overview>
```

```javascript
document.querySelector('ogm-overview').addEventListener('boundsChange', event => {
  // west, south, east, north - with east numerically west of west for a box crossing the antimeridian
  console.log('New bounds:', event.detail);
});
```

Set `search-bounds` to the area a search is currently filtered to. It's drawn as a box and the camera frames it, with the same gap everything else on the map gets. It will accept an `ENVELOPE` string, or anything else MapLibre reads as bounds — and being a string, it can come from an attribute:

```html
<ogm-overview search-bounds="ENVELOPE(-124.41,-114.13,42.01,32.53)"></ogm-overview>
```

Set `view-bounds` to where the map should open in place of the whole world, when there's no active search and no results of its own to frame - a catalog's home page, say. Given in the same form as `search-bounds`:

```html
<ogm-overview view-bounds="ENVELOPE(-124.41,-114.13,42.01,32.53)"></ogm-overview>
```

### Content Security Policy

The viewer runs work off the main thread in web workers: MapLibre's own, and one pool that decodes Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF tiles. Both are built from source the bundle carries rather than from files of their own, so a page that sets a Content-Security-Policy needs `blob:` in `worker-src` - or in whichever of `child-src`, `script-src` or `default-src` it falls back to. In a document with an opaque origin, such as a sandboxed iframe, the decoder uses a `data:` URL instead, which a policy would have to allow in the same place.

Without either, the map cannot be drawn at all, and COG tiles are decoded on the main thread: slower, but still drawn.

Decoding those tiles needs `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` in `script-src` as well, wherever it happens: the LZW and LERC decoders are WebAssembly modules, and a policy that won't instantiate one fails the preview rather than slowing it down - the alert in place of the map quotes the directive that stopped it.

The icons the viewer's chrome is drawn with are carried the same way, as data URLs, and Web Awesome draws an icon by fetching whichever URL it is handed - so `connect-src` needs `data:` as well, or every icon comes out blank. LERC's WebAssembly module is compiled in as a data URL for the same reason and reached the same way, so it needs nothing further. The theme asks for nothing at all: it is adopted as a constructed stylesheet, which no CSP directive covers.

## Development

After cloning the repository, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You can start a local development web server with:

```bash
npm start
```

### Formatting

Code is formatted using Prettier. To format your code for a pull request, run:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

To type-check and lint your code, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Tests

You can run all tests together or specify a test type:

```bash
npm test                  # runs all tests
npm run test:unit         # runs only unit tests
npm run test:component    # runs only component tests
```

Unit tests use the `*.test.ts` extension, while component tests use `*.test.tsx`.

For more information on testing, see the [Stencil documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/testing-overview).

### Releasing

Pushing a version tag publishes it. Update the version in `package.json`, run `npm install` so the lockfile agrees, and commit that on `main`. Then tag it:

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z # replace with your new version number
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The `Release` workflow checks that the tag and `package.json` agree, lints, tests, publishes to npm, and drafts the GitHub release with generated notes. It authenticates with npm over OIDC using [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers).
